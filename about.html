<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
My name is Sourav Pujari, and I am a dedicated computer science student passionate about technology and innovation.<br> 
With a keen interest in software development and data analysis, <br>
I have honed my skills through rigorous academic coursework and hands-on projects.<br>
 My educational journey has been complemented by my active participation in coding competitions and tech forums,<br>
  where I have not only showcased my abilities but also learned from the best in the field. <br>
  This blend of theoretical knowledge and practical experience has prepared me well for the challenges and opportunities in the tech industry.</p>
  <br>

<p>
In addition to my technical skills, I have a natural talent for anchoring and debating. <br>
My experience as an anchor in various college events has helped me develop strong communication skills and the ability to engage and entertain audiences. <br>
Participating in debate competitions has further sharpened my analytical thinking and persuasive abilities. <br>
These experiences have not only been incredibly fulfilling but have also enhanced my confidence and public speaking skills,<br>

<p>
Beyond my academic and extracurricular activities, I have a deep passion for writing and a keen interest in psychology. <br>
Writing allows me to express my thoughts creatively and analytically, whether through essays, articles, or short stories. <br>
It is a hobby that complements my technical pursuits by providing a creative outlet. <br>
My fascination with psychology stems from a desire to understand human behavior and cognition,<br>
 which adds a unique perspective to my problem-solving approach in technology and life. <br>
 This interdisciplinary interest in writing and psychology enriches my overall profile and fuels my curiosity and passion for continuous learning.</p>
